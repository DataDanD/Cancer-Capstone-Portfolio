# Python Packages

Algorithms used in project; links published from the creators or current team.
Sites have overview, parameters, examples, and sometimes raw code for model. 

[random forest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html), 
[gradient boosting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html), 
[ada(adaptive)boost](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostRegressor), 
and [cat(categorical)boost](https://tech.yandex.com/catboost/)
with default parameters. 
Links above are to exact models used, first three from python machine learning package SK-Learn. 
Catboost is an algorithm released by Russian company Yandex which is trying to break into the world AI scene and downloaded from web. 
If you are interested in learning about a new state of the art model, read about CatBoost!

After deciding on best model, of the four mentioned in section, for this problem, 
we can compare to another web downloaded model [XG(Extreme Gradient)Boost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost).
XGBoost is the current go to and considered king of the boosting algorithm family by data scientist.
