# Multicollinearity

## Define
In statistics, multicollinearity is when features in data used for regression models have strong correlation values. 
Having already explored correlations in probably too much detail we should understand what a regression models is used for
Then get into this relationship problem happening between correlated features.
Regression models are a commonly used type of machine learning algorithm used for predicting numerical targets.

## Regression Issues
Having correlated features, makes the effects of features
on the target variable hard to distinguish from each other.
Making model train longer.
