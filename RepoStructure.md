# Complete Structure of Document in File

**Folders:**
- LinkedText: split sections available here for your viewing pleasure
- PythonScripts: most of the codes written during experiment
     - Scripts that were useful are hopefully linked to zone it helped
- JupyterNotebook: explore data sets individually and finding useful features
     - EDA on data from early files; connected sporadically in repository
- ProjectGraphs: contains most visualizations from data analyzed for study
     - Graphical programs: Python, Jupyter, and Tableau
     
     
     
     
     
ToDo:
